# Mastermind-Solver
<h4> 
As a way of getting extra credit in one of the math courses I took at Stony Brook, we were given mastermind problems to complete and the first 5 people to solve the problems won. I decided to write a small script which would generate the answers based on the input, so that is what this project is about!
